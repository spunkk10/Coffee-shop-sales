# Coffee-shop-sales

 Happy to announce my recent project in which i did the Coffee Shop Sales Analysis using MS Excel, culminating in an interactive dashboard that revealed key business insights.
 This project significantly enhanced my data analytics skills, specifically in data cleaning, data modelling , data visualization and the use of power query editor, power pivot for data cleaning and formatting and 
 the use of pivot tables for insightful dashboard creation. From understanding sales trends to identifying customer favourites, this project has fuelled my passion for data analytics even more.
This project highlights the power of Excel for data analysis and visualisation.
